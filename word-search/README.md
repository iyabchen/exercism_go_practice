# Word Search

Create a program to solve a word search puzzle.

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific
words in them.

For example:

```
gefblpepre
cbmdcimguc
oikoknrjsm
pbwjrqrota
rixilelhgs
woncqlispc
schemekmgr
alxhprubyi
javaocamlp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left,
vertical and diagonal.

Create a program that given a puzzle and a list of words returns the location
of the first and last letter of each word.

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .
