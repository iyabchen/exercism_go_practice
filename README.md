Golang exercise from exercism http://exercism.io/languages/go/about

Most of the practices are easier questions than the the easy category in leetcode,
more for fun and syntax practices.

gigaseconds - adding giga seconds to a time, practices for package time
bank-account - deposit/withdraw money, practices for simple concurrency control
circular-buffer - implemnt read/write in circular-buffer
